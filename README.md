# Stock-Market-Analysis
Stock Market is very unpredictable. Any geographical, political change can affect stock market. I have created this stock prediction system using LSTM - RNN. It gives us future predictions of stocks based
on their past 2 years data. Time is an independent variable in LSTM. LSTM is best suited for multi-variate time series analysis.
Tensorflow, Keras, Plotly for visualizations, Standard Scaler from Sklearn library I have used to create this machine.

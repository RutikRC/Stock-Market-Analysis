# Stock-Market-Analysis
Stock Market is very unpredictable. Any geographical, political change can affect stock market. I have created this stock prediction system using LSTM - RNN. It gives us future predictions of stocks based
on their past 5 years data. We are implementing Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classification, Support Vector Machine To check which model is best suited for this data. 
Our conclusion is Logistic regression and Random Forest Classifier have the best accuracy score and is best suited for the data
